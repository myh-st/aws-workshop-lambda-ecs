- **Documentation**: [https://aws.github.io/copilot-cli/](https://aws.github.io/copilot-cli/)

The AWS Copilot CLI is a tool for developers to build, release and operate production-ready containerized applications
on AWS App Runner or Amazon ECS on AWS Fargate.

Use Copilot to:

- Deploy production-ready, scalable services on AWS from a Dockerfile in one command.
- Add databases or inject secrets to your services.
- Grow from one microservice to a collection of related microservices in an application.
- Set up test and production environments, across regions and accounts.
- Set up CI/CD pipelines to release your services to your environments.
- Monitor and debug your services from your terminal.

## Getting started

Make sure you have the AWS command line tool installed and have already run `aws configure` before you start.

To get a sample app up and running in one command, run the following:

```sh
copilot init --app demo                 \
 --name web-login                       \
 --type 'Load Balanced Web Service'     \
 --dockerfile './Dockerfile'            \
 --deploy
```

This will create a VPC, Application Load Balancer, an Amazon ECS Service with the sample app running on AWS Fargate.
This process will take around 8 minutes to complete - at which point you'll get a URL for your sample app running! ðŸš€
